# Privacy Policy

Command Reopen does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

The app monitors application activation events locally on your Mac to detect when you switch apps via Command+Tab. This information is processed entirely on-device and is never sent to any server.

## Permissions

- **Screen Recording** (optional): Used to detect whether an app already has visible windows, avoiding unnecessary reopen actions. No screen content is captured or stored.
