## Command Reopen
Reopen closed & minimized windows with `Command+Tab`

Without this app, the built-in Command+Tab cannot reopen windows that are closed but still running in the background.
You have to go to the Dock or Launchpad to open them again.

Key features:
- Reopen closed windows with Command+Tab
- Reopen minimized windows with Command+Tab
- No system permissions required, including Accessibility
- Does not modify or replace the native Command+Tab behavior
